        <p>1001 Nights Cast, Barbara Campbell<br><br>The website explains, 'Barbara Campbell performs a short text-based work each night for 1001 consecutive nights. The performance is relayed as a live webcast to anyone, anywhere, who is logged on to the website at the appointed time, that is, sunset at the artist's location'. This project is a collection of stories written by the Barbara Campbell. Each story creates the context for the subsequent stories, which are individually posted each night. According to her site, Barbara reads journalists' reports each morning that discuss events in the Middle East and adds to her story based on her findings. She creates the art in watercolor and then reconfigures it to be displayed online. I was personally very impressed by the mechanics of the site. All the art shown on her site is original work and is beautifully placed behind the animated text of the story. I really enjoyed how the text on the site is timed so that it disappears after a certain period of time and new text appears to continue telling the story. If you click on the text at any given point, the story stops and takes you to a separate web page where a more in-depth description is posted about that part of the story. The web site has very high functionality and is exceptionally beautiful in terms of visual aesthetics.<br><br>15 Hiding Places, Adrian Van Allen<br><br>Van Allens project is an interactive website that he describes as a 'literal attempt to personalize/instill nostalgia into abstract scientific knowledge'. He has used photographs from various public sources to create a collection of similar images that form a short story. I felt a strong connection to the nostalgic aspect of Van Allens project. The images mimic the jars that a middle school student could find in the corner of their biology class. The images are very beautiful and powerful, and I became more enthralled as I continued to examine them up close. When you hover over the images of various beakers full of biological materials, the image expands so that the contents of the jar are magnified. This is a very unique and inspiring way of learning about complex ideas and scientific phenomena. His site creates a special place in time that allows viewers to explore the materials that they never had time to indulge in between their classes when they were younger. The website itself is very simple, only comprising of a few elements: the images, and the text. The minimalistic design of the site is brilliant, though, because it allows the images to speak for themselves and forces the viewer to engage and interact more closely with the images to uncover the various nuances and complexities of Van Allens narrative.<br><br>1833 Chicago City Limits (Chicago, IL), Christian Marc Schmidt<br><br>Schmidts Chicago City Limits project is a unique and personal take on Google Earth, which focuses on the political and historical boundaries within cities. Using still photography, he traces around Chicago to highlight how specific sites have had heavily influenced the way that the city has grown and evolved. I really enjoyed this project, because it tells the story of the city throughout time from a very specific point of view. As you click around on his site, you are taken from point to point of different historical locations.
