        <h1>Twine Game Response</h1>
        <p>You Will Select A Decision by Brendan Patrick Hennessy<br>Hennessys Twine Game worked in the classic Twine Game format. The Game is not so much of a game as it is a library with various links to stories written by the author. I appreciated how the game included multiple links to different readings, but I found the site to be difficult to navigate. The most interesting part about his work is that you could click on different titles and it would transfer you to a small sample of the reading. I thought that this game worked like a kindle, where when you click to turn the page, the story continues. Instead, I was confused about what the gameâ€™s purpose ultimately was. I think it would have been more interesting if the game acted like a website where you could read different books and could either choose the ending, or the ending was easily accessible.<br><br>Here is my own take on a Twine Game. My game is inspired by the Super Mario game series, and the concept of the damsel in distress that is common in video games. My game aims to re-write the narrative for female characters in games. The gamer plays from the perspective of Mario, but instead of havign to save Princess Peach, they must decide to either act as an ally to the Princess by fighting off the enemy leader Bowser or fight Bowser directly by forcing him to confront his own issues.
